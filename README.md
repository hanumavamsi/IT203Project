# IT203Project
# We have 2 separate strategies ijmplemented for the project 
# BinaryHunt - Input the number of people in the room and number of spies in the room considering the number of spies will always be less than n/2. n being number of people in the room 

# Spider_interrogation - Input the number of people in the room and number of spies in the room considering the number of spies will always be less than n/2. n being number of people in the room 

# The number of questions will be displayed for both spider interrogation and binary hunt

# The code uses a random allocation for the spies, that is they randomly present in the room because we built the code for a number more than 10. So we cannot be asking each and everyone about their identity and input.
